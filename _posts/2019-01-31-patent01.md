The present disclosure provides methods and apparatus relating to a 5G or pre-5G communication system for supporting a higher data rate than that of a 4G communication system, such as long term evolution (LTE). A method for processing traffic at a core network entity processes traffic includes transmitting a message for requesting assistance information to at least one base station, receiving the assistance information from the at least one base station, splitting the traffic based on the received assistance information, and transmitting the split traffic through a core network. A core network entity includes a transceiver and a processor configured to control the transceiver to transmit a message for requesting assistance information to at least one base station, receive the assistance information from the at least one base station, split traffic based on the received assistance information, and transmit data through the split traffic.
