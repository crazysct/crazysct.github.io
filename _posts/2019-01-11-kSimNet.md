We introduce 5G K-SimNet, a network simulator for evaluating end-to-end performance of the fifth generation (5G) cellular system.5G K-SimNet provides the features of 5G new radio (NR), 5G core, multi-radio access technology (RAT) protocol, traffic management on multi-connectivity, and software-defined network/network function virtualization (SDN/NFV). In this paper, we present the features of 5G K-SimNet, scenarios that can be simulated by using the simulator, and the simulation results.
